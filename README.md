# Randomization algorithm application project
 We are going to calculate the winning probabilities of “player” ,“banker” and “tie” in the game of Baccarat (which is explained further), with the use of Monte Carlo and Las Vegas Algorithms

1.)	Monte Carlo Algorithm:

Monte Carlo is that class of algorithm which may return the correct result or the incorrect result with some probability. The algorithm resources used in this are often bounded and thus it has a deterministic or fixed run time. It gives better probability results when it is run for a larger number of iterations.

2.)	Las Vegas Algorithm:

A Las Vegas algorithm returns the correct or optimum result always, and informs when it fails. Its run time differs at each run since it depends on a random value, even for the same input.
